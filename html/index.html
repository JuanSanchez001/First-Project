	<h2><u> More reasons why you should play Futbol</u></h2>
	
	<p>&bull; Futbol is played throughout the world by a lot of people and is a very popular sport. There is an estimated 250 million people playing futbol proffesionaly. It is not difficult to understand. There are
	22 people in total and 11 players are one 1 of 2 teams. They try to either score in to a net, or they are trying to get the ball away from their own net towards the opposing team's net. Which ever team has 
	the scored the most goals(balls in to the net) wins. The popularity of futbol is not new and its modern version has been around for more than a century. Even countries have their own national team where they
	compete against different countries in a friendly match, a tournament, or the most popular event globally which is the World Cup organized by FIFA, and hosted in a variety of countries every four years.</P>
	
	<p>&bull; It is a very fun and entertaining way to get exercise. Normally going on a run consists of putting on some running shoes and running a specific route or direction. Actively participating in running while 
	playing the sport isn't constant and at some point you will slow down or come to a stop. When you are playing you don't really think about the fact that you are running, but you do think of trying to get a hold
	of the ball to score or to block someone from scoring. This pretty much distracts you. It won't get rid of you feeling tired but it will help motivate you a little more to run.</p>
	
	<p>&bull; When you discover the sport you might come across people who enjoy playing the sport too. This could lead to finding friends/people you wouldn't have ever met if it weren't for the soccer. You are able to 
	create friends groups that push each other to be better and to pick you up if you are feeling down.</p>
